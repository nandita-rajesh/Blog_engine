# Blog Engine

## Overview
This project is a minimal blog engine developed using Rust and the Rocket framework. It allows users to create, edit, view, and delete blog posts, providing a simple yet functional interface for managing content. The application stores posts in memory, featuring a straightforward HTML-based front end to interact with the underlying data.

## Approach
The development approach focused on creating a user-friendly interface and ensuring that essential functionalities were implemented effectively. I started by designing the core structure, including routes for managing posts and a basic HTML form for content submission. The goal was to build a lightweight blog engine that could be easily extended in the future. Throughout the process, I aimed to maintain clean and readable code, making use of Rust's strong type system to handle data safely.

## Reason for Incompletion
Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the project due to time constraints and other tasks in my academic schedule. While I laid a solid foundation for the blog engine, I couldn't implement additional features such as database integration and user authentication as planned. However, I believe the groundwork established in this project can serve as a stepping stone for further development and enhancements in the future.
